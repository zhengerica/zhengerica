I chose to use hash tables for grouping riders because they are more efficient for lookups and updates, especially when working with larger datasets. For the grids, I used vectors since they provide faster and simpler access compared to lists, which made handling the pickup and dropoff locations easier.

This project was a big learning experience for me. Before starting, I didnâ€™t fully understand JSON or how hash tables work, but I took the time to explore and learn how to use them effectively. It was challenging to research some of the concepts I needed, and it took a lot of trial and error to figure things out, but in the end, I came away with a much stronger understanding of both.

Overall, while the process was difficult, I learned a lot about working with data structures, debugging efficiently, and applying JSON and hash tables in a real-world scenario. It was a tough but rewarding experience!
